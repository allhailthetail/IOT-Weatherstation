#+title: Introduction to Monarch

* What is Monarch
Monarch is a weather utility that queries the NOAA weather.gov API interface
given a valid (presumably US-based) GPS coordinate.

* How can I use Monarch
Monarch is a Python package/application and can be used as such. Currently, the
project uses a number of add-on Python packages, so using a virtual environment is recommended.

Alternatively, there is a "dockerfile" that is in fact set up to use Podman.
